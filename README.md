# angularTodoApp
A simple todo application written in angularjs

This is my first application written in Angular so I would love critical feedback. Also please excuse my UI and CSS, I am not a designer, I attempted to utilze Twitter Bootstrap to the best of my creative abilities.
Eventually I might connect this to a node server and mongodb but that might be a different project.
Feel free to copy, distribute, use, or modify the code to your discretion.

Cheers,
Mr. Foots
